Welcome to the Final Project
or this year called the dix-sept-erledigt.

After you figure out what you are going to be doing, 
--and who is part of your squad, 
--create groups on git and
--get to learning and planning

Create some goals and milestones in git.

I would like to connect you with a programmer from the wild.
So, I need to know what you are thinking, and have a paragraph description of your project to share.
We have a draft to match mentors and groups, so make it compelling.
